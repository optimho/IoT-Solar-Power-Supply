# IoT-Solar-Power-Supply
A small but highly efficient Solar power supply for electronics 

The repo consists of eagle cad files and a zip file with fabrication ready gerber files.

The power supply will charge a Lithium Ion 18650 battery and supply up to 4.1-3.0v 1A.
The battery voltage is monitored so that it will not run the battery flat and protect the battery. 

There is no short circuit protection on the device, so consider a 5v 1.5A fuse if you think that it is necssary.
